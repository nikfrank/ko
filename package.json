  "readme": "ko is a project generator written in bash\n\nthe name comes from the game of go, where ko is a rule\nwhich disallows infinite repitions. I like that name for this.\n\n\nI use bash to copy files around and replace parts of them\n\nso why would I write an automator for that in bad OO js?\n\nand why would I require user interaction in an automator?\n\n\nthese are just a few problems I have with current solutions.\n\n\n---\n\nwe want to be able to set constants in our project\n\nand then use those constants to render files (one dir at a time usually)\n\ninto our project\n\n\nfirst step:\n\na generator with a dir structure of\n\npackage.json\n/:command/{package.json, sourcefile.template.*}\n\n\nwould allow us to issue the commands\n\nko command subcommand cli-param --option\n\nwhere options are listed in the package.json[ko]\n\nie\n\nko directive ko-table-paginator ko\n\nwhich would make a directive called ko-table-paginator in components/ko/\n\n((the generator command has ./components as a default directory))\n\n---\n\nlater\n\nalso commands can have nicknames which are lazier to type\n\nko d ko-table-paginator ko\n\nand maybe a smart generator would use the namespace to place the files!\n\n---\n\nthis first generator I'm writing is for angular es6\n\nand the rendering will be done by bash itself\n\nfrankly, anything more would be overkill.",
